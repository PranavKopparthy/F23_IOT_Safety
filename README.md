## About The Project

WakeWheel is an innovative solution designed to enhance driver safety and well-being by integrating heartbeat sensors into a steering wheel cover. This device is equipped to monitor the driver's heartbeat in real-time, providing an effective means to prevent drowsiness and promote alert driving. Additionally, it is designed to seamlessly communicate with a React frontend through Firebase, allowing for timely alerts and notifications.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/PranavKopparthy/F23_IOT_Safety.git
   ```
2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Install FIrebase packages
   ```sh
   npm -g install firebase-tools
   firebase login
   firebase init
    ```
4. You will need to make an .env.local file inside frontend to store certain credentials for your app safely. Never push Firebase credentials to GitHub!
   ```sh
   REACT_APP_AUTH_DOMAIN=""
   REACT_APP_DATABASE_URL=""
   REACT_APP_PROJECT_ID=""
   REACT_APP_STORAGE_BUCKET=""
   REACT_APP_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=""
   REACT_APP_ID=""
    ```
5. Upload Arduino.ino to esp
   ```sh
   1. Install Arduino IDE:
      Download and install the Arduino IDE from https://www.arduino.cc/en/software.
   2. Install ESP32 Board Support:
      Open the Arduino IDE, go to "File" -> "Preferences," and add the following URL to the "Additional Boards Manager URLs"       field:
      https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json
   3. Install Required Libraries:
      Install the necessary libraries for your Arduino project. Open the Arduino IDE, go to "Sketch" -> "Include Library" ->       "Manage Libraries," and install the following          libraries:
